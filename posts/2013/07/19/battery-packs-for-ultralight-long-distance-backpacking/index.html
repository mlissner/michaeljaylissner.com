            <p>Obviously, the best ultalight battery pack is <strong>no</strong> battery pack, 
but on our trip we're going to be bringing a phone, a camera, 
an MP3 player and two headlamps. The phone doubles as our GPS and the 
headlamps might be USB rechargeable. Having spare energy to get us through 
longer sections is important.</p>
<p>I've completed <a href="//michaeljaylissner.com/archive/battery-research.xlsx">some research</a>, investigating which are the best 
options. As I
was reviewing the many battery pack and solar charger solutions that are 
out there, I came to a few conclusions right off the bat:</p>
<ul>
<li>The models with turbines, like the <a href="http://www.shopetoncorp.com/detail/ETO+NBOTU2000+RED">Eton BoostTurbine2000</a> are crap. I
  called Eton to ask them how many cranks it would take to charge a phone. The technical support guy's response: "You'd be at it all day. These are meant for emergency use only." So turbines are out.</li>
<li>The idea of using a solar panel is great, but doing so will suck. I 
 looked far and wide for an ultralight solar panel, but they're all heavier than just getting a battery pack. The problem with solar panels is that they need to have their own battery packs, so you end up carrying the extra battery pack <strong>and</strong> the panel itself. If you're out for really long trips, these are probably worth it, but for trips where you'll be in and out of towns, there are lighter options.</li>
<li>There are a million wannabe battery pack manufacturers, like Timetec, 
 Powergen, Rokit and Unu. They're strong on branding, but when you go to their 
 website &mdash; if they have one &mdash; you'll find more marketing but not
  much real innovation or information. For example, in my attached chart, 
  there are many blank spots and questions marks for these brands. </li>
</ul>
<p>Looking for battery packs for backpackers means finding one that's light, 
durable and efficient. There are a few features you probably want in particular: </p>
<ul>
<li>You want a battery pack that will charge your devices as quickly as they
  support. Many battery packs, particularly the small ones, 
  only provide 1 amp of output from a single USB port. If you have a device
   that can handle more (like a tablet), it'll charge quite slowly. The 
   best ones have as much as 2.5A output, and will adapt to send the right 
   amount of power to your device.</li>
<li>You want a battery pack that charges quickly when you plug it into the 
 wall. You don't want to get stuck in town overnight because of how slowly 
 your battery pack charges. </li>
<li>You want a battery pack that offers "pass through charging". This allows
  you to plug the battery into the wall, and plug your device into the 
  battery -- simultaneously -- allowing you to charge both at the same time. Most battery packs don't offer this. </li>
<li>Finally, you want the most energy packed into the smallest, lightest device. </li>
</ul>
<p>When looking at all these features, there are three standout energy packs, 
the <a href="http://www.myinnergie.com/productdetail.php?productid=237&amp;languageid=1">Innergie PocketCell Duo</a>, the <a href="http://www.ianker.com/anker-astro-external-battery-backup-charger/product/79UN53V1-B8P56A">Anker Astro 5600</a> and 
the <a href="http://usa.just-mobile.com/all/gum-doubleplus.html">Just Mobile Gum++</a>. </p>
<p>The Anker Astro ($30) is the lightest of the bunch, but it also is complex,
charges slowly when plugged in, and has a complex body. It has a 
flashlight, for what that's worth, and, at 4.2 ounces, 
has an energy density of 1333 mAh/oz. It does not appear to have 
passthrough functionality. </p>
<p>The Just Mobile Gum++ ($90) is a very simple, lightweight and durable 
option. At 4.6 ounces, it's still very light. It has a slightly lower 
energy density from the Astro (1304 mAh/oz), but boasts an ABS shell, 
the fastest charge rate when plugged in (2500 mA), and just generally looks
like a good, simple option.</p>
<p>Finally is the Innergie PocketCell Duo ($90). This is the most powerful of 
the bunch, at 6800 mAh, has the highest energy density at 1456 mAh/oz) and 
has two output ports (both at 2100 mA). Unfortunately, unlike the Gum++, 
it only chargest at 1500 mA, so it will take longer to charge. </p>
<p>The PocketCell and Gum++ are both very new products, 
and don't have many reviews. The Anker has been around awhile and has 
decent reviews, though some upset people that aren't happy with their products. </p>
<p>Here's my recommendation: If you need a battery pack that can charge two 
devices at the same time, get the Innergie PocketCell Duo. If not, 
get the Just Mobile Gum++. If you want to do your own analysis, 
check out the attached spreadsheet and go wild.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since Innergie does not mention whether their device supports 
pass through, I've contacted them via their contact form and via Twitter. 
After more than two months, they've been entirely non-responsive. There is 
another person on their Twitter stream that is complaining (loudly) that 
they never responded to a broken device complaint that he had. I can't 
recommend Innergie despite their slick device, great marketing, 
etc. Something is going wrong with that company.</p>
