&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite utilities lately is the Disk Usage Analyzer that comes 
installed on Ubuntu. It can be run either locally or remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty awesome. I have been playing with my backups lately, 
and this utility allows me not only to see which directories are large, 
but also where my files are taking up the most space. For example, 
the picture at right depicts my home directory. By mousing over the slices 
of the pie, you can see what's in them, and how big they are. By clicking on
a slice, it becomes the center of the pie, and you can see which directories
are within it (and how big they are). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of UI, I have to say this one works very well for me. I have yet to
see another app for this purpose anywhere else, though admittedly I have 
not been looking that hard.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Linux"></category><category term="storage"></category></entry></feed>
