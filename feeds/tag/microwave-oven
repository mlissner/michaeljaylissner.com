I mean really. We can see how hot things are using infrared cameras. We can put infrared cameras in microwaves. Why must we always type in a length of time that we want things to cook for, when really, all we want is to press a button labeled &amp;#8220;Make my food&amp;nbsp;hot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally looked into this idea today. It&amp;#8217;s been &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=MLYlAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=5693247"&gt;patented by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LG&lt;/span&gt; since 1997&lt;/a&gt;. So, there goes that&amp;nbsp;idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish they would make one. Imagine a microwave where you dial the power level, then press go. When the food is hot, it stops. Ah, the future&amp;#8230;err&amp;#8230;the 1997 patent that never went anywhere. Maybe we can free this patent because it&amp;#8217;s not &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness"&gt;non-obvious&lt;/a&gt; anymore.&amp;nbsp;Doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="patent"></category><category term="microwave oven"></category></entry></feed>
