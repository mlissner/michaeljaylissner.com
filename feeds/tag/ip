I thought I would do a little experiment to see how much I would be in for if my entire collection were to be found to be illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do some math. I have 3,876 tracks, at $150,000 each. So if my entire collection were to be found illegal, that means it would cost me $581.4 million dollars &amp;mdash; about .6 billion dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, let's assume that I can live with that reality. It just seems odd that I could have bought those songs for $3,876 on amazon.com, or iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something isn't quite right here. Also, did I mention that all US digital music sales &lt;a href="http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_resources/dmr2008.html"&gt;are estimated&lt;/a&gt; to total $2.9B in 2007? That makes my music worth about 20% of the 2007 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="copyright"></category><category term="IP"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="law"></category></entry><entry><title>Mr. Rogers on the Usage of VCRs</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/11/22/mr-rogers-on-the-usage-of-vcrs/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-11-22T17:13:23+01:00</updated><author><name>Michael Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-11-22:posts/2008/11/22/mr-rogers-on-the-usage-of-vcrs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found a good quote by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Rogers"&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/a&gt; himself today. I knew I always liked this guy. Too bad he couldn't live forever. This quote is a bit dated, but the point is still good. It also helps to imagine his voice before reading this:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the "Neighborhood" at hours when some children cannot use it. I think that it's a real service to families to be able to record such programs and show them at appropriate times. I have always felt that with the advent of all this new technology that allows people to tape the "Neighborhood" off-the-air, and I'm speaking for the "Neighborhood" because that's what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of their family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been "You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions." Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You tell them Mr. Rogers. You tell 'em.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="copyright"></category><category term="VCR"></category><category term="IP"></category></entry></feed>
