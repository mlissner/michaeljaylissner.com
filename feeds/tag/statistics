When I am browsing for music, I just never get that far in the list. For some time, I've wondered if this is my fault, or if I just have more music in the front of my collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time came to do a little stats work and figure out why this is. Here are the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a strong predominance of the letters A-E, there is also one in the P-T range. This leads me to believe that I should hunt for music in that area more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No Alt" src="//michaeljaylissner.com/images/Number of Occurances Pentads-img1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I expected A-E to come out ahead, who would have thought that B would have more than 80 artists, almost twice the second most common letter? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No Alt" src="//michaeljaylissner.com/images/Number of Occurances Pentads-img2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what conclusions does this lead to? One: That I need to look at my music beyond the letter D. Two: That B is a very popular letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those wondering about their own music collection, if you browse to your music folder and run the following, it will tell you how many artists starting with that letter you have. For the example below, it tells me I have 30 artists with the letter 'A'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Music&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category><category term="statistics"></category><category term="visualizations"></category></entry></feed>
