One of them has been teaching &lt;a href="http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i153-waim/su10/#" target="_blank"&gt;Web Architecture and Information Management&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt; Berkeley with two other guys from the School of Information. It&amp;#8217;s been a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TON&lt;/span&gt; of work for not a whole lot of pay, but it&amp;#8217;s been really&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the three of us split up the work, I only have to do about four lectures, but the class is two and a half hours long three times a week, which is a lot of talking time. I imagine it&amp;#8217;s not easy for the students to be in the class that frequently&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m giving lectures on the following&amp;nbsp;topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested, I&amp;#8217;ve posted my slides for these in the &lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/papers-and-projects"&gt;projects and papers&lt;/a&gt; section of the site. It&amp;#8217;s definitely true that the best way to learn it to&amp;nbsp;teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also been learning a little about how to get the class to participate and be involved, but that&amp;#8217;s probably the most challenging part. A lot of the students know a lot about the material, and are pretty bored, while others are seeing everything for the first time. It makes it pretty tricky, but it&amp;#8217;s working out as the class gets to know each other. We started doing student presentations this week, and that has helped everybody get a little more skin in the&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Web Architecture"></category><category term="teaching"></category><category term="summer"></category><category term="Cal"></category><category term="me"></category></entry></feed>
