grandfather, Meyer Lissner. Over the holidays, I scanned some old photos, 
and discovered that he was quite the famous fellow. Below is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_ships"&gt;liberty 
ship&lt;/a&gt; that was named after him in 1943.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also learned that my grandfather donated a &lt;strong&gt;LOT&lt;/strong&gt; of his 
papers to the Stanford Library as the &lt;a href="http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf858006bb&amp;amp;chunk.id=did-1.8.1&amp;amp;brand=oac"&gt;Meyer Lissner Papers&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't 
read up much on him yet, but he seems pretty influential to California 
history as part of a reform movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting stuff. I'm going to have to do some researching on this fellow 
one of these days.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="me"></category><category term="history"></category><category term="Meyer Lissner"></category><category term="California"></category></entry></feed>
