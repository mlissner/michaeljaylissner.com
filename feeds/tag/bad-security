&lt;p&gt;I went into the member section, and (after giving them my password for the second time in two minutes) found where my birthday was listed as &amp;#8220;on file.&amp;#8221; I clicked the edit button for that section, and in the resulting page, it again said that my birthday was &amp;#8220;on file.&amp;#8221; It did not give me a way to change&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to change it, I decided to try the help tool. I searched for &amp;#8220;change birthday,&amp;#8221; which gave me the response:&lt;blockquote&gt;Q: Why can&amp;#8217;t I change my birthdate, and why does it say, &amp;#8220;on file&amp;#8221;?
A: We use your birthdate as a security measure in case you forget your password. We would not be able to do so if you were able to change it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Great. Good work&amp;nbsp;guys.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="yahoo"></category><category term="bad security"></category></entry></feed>
