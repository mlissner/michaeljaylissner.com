new features. The first one is a set of those ubiquitous bookmarking buttons 
for Technorati, del.icio.us, etc. that you should be seeing if you are reading 
this online. I've been trying to optimize this blog for a bit, and I figured 
I probably need these sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I added today is the "Subscribe" block, which for the moment 
is listed on the left under the recent music. I did a little playing around in 
the heart of Drupal, and modified this block so that it has text links for 
RSS and for an email service I just discovered from Google.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="google"></category><category term="blog"></category><category term="drupal"></category><category term="rss"></category></entry></feed>
