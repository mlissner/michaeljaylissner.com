It&amp;#8217;s been an interesting experience, but I am shocked at the size of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt;. After installing it, updating it, installing Firefox and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVG&lt;/span&gt; antivirus, it is 5.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;13GB&lt;/span&gt; in size!&amp;nbsp;Incredible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to Fedora 6, which weighs in at 2.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;57GB&lt;/span&gt; (with server and programming software), or - hilariously - with Windows 98 at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;230MB&lt;/span&gt; (roughly a 20th of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt; was big, but that&amp;#8217;s quite something. Something else that was quite interesting is that it took nearly as long to install 98 despite its puny size. I&amp;#8217;m baffled as to how it took so long, but I&amp;#8217;m guessing it had something to do with multiple processors, which I&amp;#8217;m sure it doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="microsoft"></category><category term="virtualization"></category></entry></feed>
