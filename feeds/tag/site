I&amp;#8217;ve given the site a major revamp and a new&amp;nbsp;look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the old&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Old site" src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/images/oldsite/v3.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the&amp;nbsp;new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Old site" src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/images/oldsite/v4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of reasons I wanted to make a change, 
and I think the new design accomplishes most of them. First, 
I wanted to change to a static width layout. It was a long time coming, 
and now people with big screens and/or high resolution won&amp;#8217;t have to deal 
with ridiculous line lengths. Second, the new design should do wonders for 
links, which didn&amp;#8217;t really stand out before. Third, I&amp;#8217;ve dropped the login 
box at the right, since I was the only one that ever logged in. Actually, 
I&amp;#8217;ve dropped the whole column, so we&amp;#8217;re down to two columns now, not&amp;nbsp;three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I wasn&amp;#8217;t really planning on doing was the color change. I liked 
the muted greens, but I think the topics I discuss have largely moved away 
from environmental ones, so perhaps the blue makes more sense and will 
better evoke what I&amp;#8217;m going&amp;nbsp;for. &lt;/p&gt;
