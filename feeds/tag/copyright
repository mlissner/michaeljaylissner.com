Brian at &lt;a href="http://cyberlawcases.com/"&gt;http://cyberlawcases.com&lt;/a&gt; for the&amp;nbsp;corrections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve finally begun doing some of the actual coding for &lt;a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/masters/projects/2010/judicialnlp"&gt;my final 
project&lt;/a&gt; so the time has come to set up &lt;a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener"&gt;a mercurial repository&lt;/a&gt; to 
hold the&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we complete our project, we will have built a free product that 
competes with some of the core functionality of both LexisNexis and 
Westlaw, so something we wanted to do was make sure they couldn&amp;#8217;t steal our
code, enhance their product and thus moot&amp;nbsp;ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we&amp;#8217;re using the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt; Affero General Public License 
v3&lt;/a&gt;, which allows people to take our code for free, but requires that they 
publicly share any modifications that they make to the code. The normal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt; 
General Public License allows the code to be used at no cost, 
but only requires that changes to the code be shared with the public if one
distributes the changed version to the public. With a server-based 
project, like ours, one could operate modified versions of the code 
without ever having a need to distribute any of the software to the public. 
This loophole is closed by the Affero&amp;nbsp;license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to license our work, we must be its copyright holder. This is easy
enough, since we get copyright instantly in the U.S., but, 
as has been demonstrated in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobsen_v._Katzer"&gt;Jacobsen v. Katzer&lt;/a&gt;, in order to seek remedies 
for copyright violations, we would have to register everything we made with 
the copyright office. This &lt;a href="http://www.copyright.gov/docs/fees.html"&gt;costs $35&lt;/a&gt; per registration, 
and with open source software, it&amp;#8217;s not clear whether each and every 
version needs to be registered or just major releases, or&amp;nbsp;what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is too onerous to be practical, an additional approach to 
protecting our works is useful, and in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DMCA&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506"&gt;17 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.C.&lt;/span&gt;§ 506(d)&lt;/a&gt;), 
remedies are provided for the &amp;#8220;fraudulent removal of copyright notice.&amp;#8221; 
Although these do not (in any way) match the protections provided by normal
copyright registration, they are a useful place to begin. Thus, 
if we place a copyright notice into each file of our code, 
those using our code must either risk violating the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DMCA&lt;/span&gt; by removing these
notices, or leave our copyright information intact. (Placing such notices
in each file is also &lt;a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-howto.html"&gt;the recommendation&lt;/a&gt; of the Free Software&amp;nbsp;Foundation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To place our information into each and every file of code that we upload 
publicly, I wrote &lt;a href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/archive/checklicense.py"&gt;a short mercurial hook&lt;/a&gt; that  adds copyright and 
licensing information it to the top of every file that is modified or added 
to the repository. To use the script, simply make it executable, 
place it in the .hg directory of your project, and add the following lines
to&amp;nbsp;.hg/hgrc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[hooks]
pretxncommit = .hg/checklicense.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A couple of things I should note about this script is that it currently 
only checks for java and python files, and that it requires files called 
java_license.txt and python_license.txt to be in the root of your 
repository. It should be fairly easy to modify though to fit your own&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="mercurial"></category><category term="hook"></category><category term="Final Project"></category><category term="DMCA"></category><category term="copyright"></category><category term="Affero GPLv3"></category><category term="CourtListener"></category></entry><entry><title>Jacobsen v. Katzer Article Posted</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2009/10/03/jacobsen-v-katzer-article-posted/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-10-03T21:52:21-07:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2009-10-03:posts/2009/10/03/jacobsen-v-katzer-article-posted/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I finally finished an article I have been writing for Wikipedia, as part of my &lt;a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~bcarver/mediawiki/index.php/INFO_237_Fall_2009_Syllabus"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Law class&lt;/a&gt;. The professor for this class is the same as the one that taught the Cyberlaw class I took in the Spring, and once again, he has asked us to work on Wikipedia as part of our&amp;nbsp;classwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to choose an article on Wikipedia that was related to the class, and I chose to work on the article on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobsen_v._Katzer"&gt;Jacobsen v. Katzer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very important case as it relates to open source licensing, patent law, copyright, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DMCA&lt;/span&gt;, and just about every other possible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; law&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it was a very complicated case because Katzer has attempted to throw the book at Jacobsen (and vice versa). The court has not yet resolved all the issues, but from reading through about half of the court documents that &lt;a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/index.shtml"&gt;Jacobsen has posted&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that Katzer&amp;nbsp;has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patented technology that was not his to&amp;nbsp;patent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempted to get licensing fees from Jacobsen for those&amp;nbsp;patents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stolen the intellectual property of an open source project, stripped it of its license and then incorporated it into his own commercial&amp;nbsp;project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempted to sue Jacobsen for copyright violation for something - I&amp;#8217;m not even sure&amp;nbsp;what&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more - see the article for&amp;nbsp;details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it&amp;#8217;s a nasty, nasty case, but ultimately it should work out for Jacobsen, and he should come out the better (or at least none the worse). At a minimum, he has to prove that the patents are invalid, Katzer stole his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, and that he didn&amp;#8217;t steal Katzer&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; - a walk in the&amp;nbsp;park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, that&amp;#8217;s easier said than done, but he&amp;#8217;s fighting what appears to be the good fight, and it looks like if he keeps at it, he will win in the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="patent"></category><category term="paper"></category><category term="open source"></category><category term="Jacobsen v.

&lt;p&gt;29 December&amp;nbsp;2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr.&amp;nbsp;Gore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applaud your efforts towards educating the world on the subject of 
anthropogenic climate change, and I congratulate you on your Nobel&amp;nbsp;Prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write today to urge you to adopt a more open copyright on your materials. 
From what I can deduce, you are relying on the standard American copyright 
for your movie, presentations and books. As a lawyer, 
I am sure you are aware that this copyright system gives you incredible 
strength to protect the fruit of your efforts, however for many people, 
this system hampers their access to reading your books, 
watching your movie, or enjoying your&amp;nbsp;presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPCC&lt;/span&gt; have been recognized as the greatest laborers towards 
educating the world on this subject, and I understand if you have taken the 
traditional route with your work. Recently however, as I began purchasing 
the third copy of your movie to give away to a friend, 
I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but think about how great it would be if it were simply 
streamed from your&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many options for creating a more open copyright system, 
and I hope you will take the time to consider the implications of your 
current&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

I thought I would do a little experiment to see how much I would be in for if my entire collection were to be found to be&amp;nbsp;illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s do some math. I have 3,876 tracks, at $150,000 each. So if my entire collection were to be found illegal, that means it would cost me $581.4 million dollars &amp;mdash; about .6 billion&amp;nbsp;dollars. &lt;/p&gt;

I know this post is going to alienate just about everybody that would ever consider reading my blog, but here&amp;#8217;s the deal: I want all iPods to support the ogg file&amp;nbsp;format. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the uninitiated, the ogg format is like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; or the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAC&lt;/span&gt; format, except for a couple of very important differences. One, it&amp;#8217;s free, which is to say that it doesn&amp;#8217;t belong to some company, and every time I use it I&amp;#8217;m not supposed to be giving them a nickel or something. (The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; format technically is licensed to the company that created it, so theoretically, every time you buy a computer, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player, etc., you&amp;#8217;re supposed to give them some quantity of&amp;nbsp;money.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The other reason that I am hereby requesting ogg on my iPod  is because it&amp;#8217;s better. It sounds better. It compresses better. Are there other metrics that we should be using? None that I know of. I want ogg. Steve Jobs, do you hear me&amp;nbsp;now?! 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, the theoretical argument above holds water, but I have personal reasons for this desire: I have 357 ogg files that I can&amp;#8217;t listen to on my iPod! This pretty much gives me three choices: One, install &lt;a href="http://www.rockbox.org/" title="Rockbox.org"&gt;Rockbox&lt;/a&gt; on my iPod (I have, it didn&amp;#8217;t work reliably). Two, convert the ogg files to MP3s (this solution would create inferior-quality songs). Or, three, only listen to those songs on my computer (also a lame&amp;nbsp;solution). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I should also mention while I am on this rant that I have flac files as well. Why doesn&amp;#8217;t the iPod support those! iPods are great, but these are serious&amp;nbsp;shortcomings.

I had the chance to see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" title="Wikipedia Link"&gt;Richard Stallman &lt;/a&gt;speak the other day at the &lt;a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu" title="ischool.berkeley.edu"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt; Berkeley School of Information&lt;/a&gt;, and it was quite an experience. In case you don&amp;#8217;t know the name, Richard Stallman is the man behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt; is the software/philosophy that makes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt;/Linux what it is. Stallman&amp;#8217;s belief is that all software, and indeed just about everything that you create should be freely available to anybody that wants it. This is in stark opposition to the Microsoftian or even the Apple perspective of software, and indeed Stallman has written a book about this called *Free Software, Free Society*. As you might expect, from a man with such beliefs, the book itself is free, and &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fsfs/rms-essays.pdf"&gt;you can find it here&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If that doesn&amp;#8217;t convince you of his awesomeness, allow me to roughly quote a part of his introduction:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Moderator: &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;Richard Stallman has been awarded with four PhD&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Stallman: &amp;#8220;&amp;#8212;That&amp;#8217;s six now.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Moderator: &amp;#8220;I guess somebody needs to update&amp;nbsp;Wikipedia&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The speech he chose was &amp;#8220;Copyright vs. Community in the Age of Computer Networks.&amp;#8221; It was a real real eye-opener for me. I assumed that the recording and publishing companies were essentially screwing the artists, but I had no idea just how bad it really was. Imagine, if you will, that your garage band suddenly became really popular, and that you got signed with a big recording company. They publish your album, and they distribute it across the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, where it sells well. You&amp;#8217;d expect that your art would probably be making you some good money, would you not? I know I would, but apparently that&amp;#8217;s not how it&amp;nbsp;works. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The way Stallman tells it, the first place they nail you is by charging you for the distribution. So, until your album has sold some critical quantity, you&amp;#8217;re still paying back the record company the loan they gave you to distribute your album (sounds vaguely like the mafia here, but it gets worse). The next place they nail you is by not giving you much of the album sales. I would think that you&amp;#8217;d be given a good buck or two of each album sold, but apparently it&amp;#8217;s more like a quarter, or maybe 50 cents. Not much profit&amp;nbsp;there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The third place they nail you is by owning your creativity. You created something from nothing, but if you want to make a copy of your album and give it to a friend, that&amp;#8217;s just too bad, you&amp;#8217;re going to have to buy the album for your friend just like everybody else. And you know what&amp;#8217;s worse? Even many years later, after your album has pretty much stopped selling, and the record company has stopped pressing it, you still don&amp;#8217;t own your creativity. In fact, as of 1998, the copyright they own for your creativity can last as long as 120 years, so even after you are long dead, they still own your music. It doesn&amp;#8217;t stop there. You now have a schedule to produce more albums for them, each with the above&amp;nbsp;problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, aren&amp;#8217;t you glad you made it big, and that copyrights are there to protect&amp;nbsp;you? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As you might expect, Stallman explains this a bit more thoroughly in his presentation, but that&amp;#8217;s the basic gist of it. As is the case with just about everything related to Richard Stallman, this essay is available for free. In fact, if you&amp;#8217;re interested in a bit of reading, &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/copyright-and-globalization.html"&gt;it&amp;#8217;s here&lt;/a&gt;.
