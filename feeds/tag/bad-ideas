grandparent's house. It's been a great trip, but one thing about it keeps 
plaguing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of days in New Orleans, and one of the places I insisted upon 
seeing was the 9th Ward, where Katrina dealt some of the worst damage. I wanted 
to see if people were recovering, and how much the place had been fixed up 
since 2005 when the storm blew through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me (aside from the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bisset_linda/3026355210/"&gt;markings&lt;/a&gt;) is that people are moving 
back into this area, rebuilding their houses, and generally, pouring money into 
the location. On the one hand, it makes sense since it's their home, but on the 
other, I can't help but think that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; should stop 
this from happening. From what I've learned while here, the 9th Ward is an area 
of New Orleans that is going to flood if there is another hurricane 
Katrina...which there will be sooner or later. Considering that Katrina 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina"&gt;killed almost 2,000 
people&lt;/a&gt; this seems rather unwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, rather than moving back in, shouldn't we be cutting our losses right about 
now, finding somewhere for these people to live, and preventing another 
disaster? Or is my logic flawed?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="policy"></category><category term="katrina"></category><category term="disaster"></category><category term="bad ideas"></category></entry></feed>
