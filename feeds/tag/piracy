&lt;p&gt;They've done an excellent job showing that the figures are absolutely bogus, but their conclusion really makes quite a point. For reference, the first figure is that 750,000 jobs have been lost due to piracy, and the second is that piracy costs $200-$250 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quote from the conclusion, after they have debunked both of the numbers:&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither figure is terribly plausible on its face. As Wired noted earlier this week, 750,000 jobs is fully 8 percent of the current number of unemployed in the United States. And $250 billion is more than the combined 2005 gross domestic revenues of the movie, music, software, and video game industries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...sounds like these numbers might be a bit exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="piracy"></category><category term="bad statistics"></category></entry></feed>
