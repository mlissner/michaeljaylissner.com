This means that it&amp;#8217;s easy to influence the vote by calling in and expressing your opinion. It&amp;#8217;s simple to do so, and more voices could change the direction of the Boy Scouts of America, allowing all boys to be included and&amp;nbsp;accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what to&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scouting.org/LocalCouncilLocator.aspx"&gt;Find your local&amp;nbsp;council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give them a call or send them an email telling them your&amp;nbsp;opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact the national council via email: &lt;a href="mailto:feedback@scouting.org"&gt;feedback@scouting.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important is to contact your local council. We need their phones to be ringing off the hook with people expressing their opinions. It truly takes no more than two minutes. Here&amp;#8217;s the San Diego council: (619) 298-6121, and the East Bay council: (925)&amp;nbsp;674-6100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer a form letter, you can &lt;a href="https://secure3.convio.net/hrc/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;amp;page=UserAction&amp;amp;id=1623&amp;amp;autologin=true&amp;amp;utm_term=link2&amp;amp;JServSessionIdr004=on4q7x9ly4.app304a"&gt;just do this one through the Human Rights Campaign&lt;/a&gt; (34,000 people already&amp;nbsp;have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a simple transcript for you to&amp;nbsp;follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m [calling/wrriting] to express my desire that the Boy Scouts immediately lift their ban on gays. This ban is discriminatory, outdated and pointless. Scouting teaches many great lessons to thousands of adolescents across the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; One lesson that Scouting should not teach is that homosexuality is somehow wrong or means for&amp;nbsp;discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 3rd, I hope that you will help the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSA&lt;/span&gt; finally makes the right decision so it can continue to lead boys into being mature and accepting&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send this to the email above, and call your local council. This could make a&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="howto"></category><category term="homosexuality"></category><category term="boy scouts"></category></entry><entry><title>To Be Silent is To Lie</title><link href="http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2008/12/05/to-be-silent-is-to-lie/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-12-05T17:01:32-08:00</updated><author><name>Mike Lissner</name></author><id>tag:michaeljaylissner.com,2008-12-05:posts/2008/12/05/to-be-silent-is-to-lie/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="No alt" src="http://michaeljaylissner.com/images/eagle-badge.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. William Steele&lt;br /&gt;
Director&lt;br /&gt;
National Eagle Scout Association&lt;br /&gt;
1325 West Walnut Hill Lane&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.O.&lt;/span&gt; Box 152079&lt;br /&gt;
Irving, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;75015-2079  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 December&amp;nbsp;2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes to be Silent is to&amp;nbsp;Lie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;Miguel de&amp;nbsp;Unamuno&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr.&amp;nbsp;Steele:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was four years old, I was a Tiger Scout. Later, I became a Cub Scout,
 and then a Webelos. When I was old enough, I became a Boy Scout. Over the 
 next few years, I advanced in rank, became an Eagle Scout and achieved many
  Eagle Palms. I had over 100 merit badges, was the Junior Assistant 
  Scoutmaster, went on the National Jamboree in Arlington, Virginia, 
  and the International Jamboree in&amp;nbsp;Chile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was what could be considered one hell of a Boy Scout. Today, 
with much bitterness and sadness, I give up the only remaining symbol of 
those parts of my life. Today, I return to you my Eagle Scout Badge, 
and in so doing, renounce and reject the prejudices and discriminative 
practices of the Boy Scouts of&amp;nbsp;America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was about 16, I learned that agnostics, atheists and gays would not 
be tolerated by the policies of the Boy Scouts. While it&amp;#8217;s true that as of 
2000, the supreme court backs your (well-funded) position as a private 
organization to discriminate institutionally, that does not make it right. 
Each of these positions flies in the face of scouting elsewhere in the 
world, and each of them reinforces an environment in which people with 
different opinions are awarded different value. While it is true that Baden 
Powell said that &amp;#8220;[no] man is much good unless he believes in God and obeys 
His laws,&amp;#8221; we sometimes must reflect on the beliefs of our founders, 
and put them in the context of their day. When Baden Powell made this 
remark, women had not yet gained suffrage, Nazi Europe had yet to come and 
go, and apartheid had yet to be institutionalized, let alone dismantled. In 
short, it was a different&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must ask ourselves what are we doing today that our children will disdain.
Today we live in a world where religious differences can be enlightening 
and can lead to greater understanding of ourselves and our peers. Yet in 
this world, religion can be used publicly as an accusation (Obama as Muslim),
and defenses to such accusations need not defend the religion, 
only the man. We live in a world today where religious differences lead to 
war, terrorism, and deaths of thousands of people. We live in a world where 
an organization designed to create leaders out of boys discriminates based 
on religion and sexual preference. If we are not careful, 
our children and their children will not look kindly upon our time as one of
freedom of opinion and religion, but rather as one of oppression, war, 
and&amp;nbsp;discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your organization has at its heart some of the greatest lessons I have 
learned during my lifetime, and it saddens me greatly to be forced to 
abandon it. I plan to have children one day, and it saddens me greatly that
they will not have the Boy or Girl Scouts of America in their lives. Most 
of all though, it saddens me that a national organization would choose not 
to include a diversity of people and&amp;nbsp;opinions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enclosed is my Eagle Scout badge, one of my more treasured possessions. I 
hope some day to get it back from you, and I hope someday that you will 
realize the error of your&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, &lt;/p&gt;
